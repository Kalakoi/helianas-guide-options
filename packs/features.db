Choose a Small or smaller creature with a challenge rating of 1/2 or lower that isn't a humanoid, giant, or swarm to become your companion. When a creature becomes your companion, it has a maximum number of hit points equal to the average of its Hit Dice, as indicated in its statistics, and it can't cast spells. Work with your GM to find a companion that suits your campaign world. This companion obeys your commands and is friendly to you and your allies.</p><p><em><strong>Vessel.</strong></em> When not summoned, your companion exists inside a magical vessel of your own design, such as a painted animal skull, bejeweled egg, or crystal sphere. While in this vessel, the companion has full cover from all attacks and other effects, is unaffected by area of effects that originate from outside the vessel, and exist in stasis; it doesn't need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe, and it is <strong>immune</strong> to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized. A companion at 0 hit points is instantly stabilized when it enters its vessel.</p><p>If a vessel is broken, or a companion is released from its vessel for any other reason, the creature within it ceases to be a tamer's companion. It acts according to its own wishes and retains any improvements it gained while a companion.</p><blockquote><p>Home Planes</p><p>Some magical effects, like the banishment spell, have the ability to permanently banish a creature back to its home plane. When a creature becomes your companion, its home plane becomes the demiplane within its vessel. If the companion becomes permanently banished by such a spell, it simply reappears in this vessel.</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>Summoning.</strong></em> As an action, you can summon your companion from a vessel, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space that you can see within <strong>30 feet</strong> of you, or any unoccupied space within <strong>5 feet</strong> of you. You can dismiss a companion within <strong>30 feet</strong> of you as a bonus action or action, drawing it back into its vessel. To summon or dismiss a companion, you must be holding its vessel in hand. You can only have one companion summoned at a time.</p><blockquote><p>Dominated Companions</p><p>A companion that is controlled by another creature, such as by the dominate monster spell, can try to resist being recalled into its vessel. When you try to recall such a creature into its vessel, it can make a <strong>Charisma saving throw</strong> against your <strong>tamer spell save DC</strong>. On a failed saving throw, it is recalled, while on a success, it is not.</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>Combat.</strong></em> In combat, your companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action or action on your turn to command it to take different actions. Those actions can be in its statistics or some other action, bonus action, or object interaction. If you are incapacitated, the companion can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge. Your companion can't take the Multiattack action until you reach 5th level in this class, even if it would otherwise be able to.</p><p><em><strong>Rest.</strong></em> A companion gains the benefits of a long rest when its tamer finishes a long rest; if it has at least 1 hit point, it regains all its hit points when you finish a long rest. Unlike other creatures, a companion can't spend its own Hit Dice to recover hit points at the end of a short rest. See the Soul Bond feature for details on recovering hit points.</p><p><em><strong>Items.</strong></em> Armour, barding, and weapons can be equipped to enhance your companion. A companion can wear or carry any equipment that their size and body shape permits. However, your companion must be proficient with the armour or weapon to make full use of it. If your companion wears armour that it lacks proficiency with, it has <strong>disadvantage</strong> on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity. A companion that is not proficient with a weapon type does not add its proficiency bonus to attack rolls made with that weapon type.</p><p><em><strong>Item Bonding.</strong></em> Over the course of an hour, you can bond a companion to one object that it can wear or carry that is not any sort of container or storage. When a companion is recalled, all items it is wearing or carrying that it is not bonded to are dropped in the space from which it was recalled. A companion can be bonded to up to 3 items at any one time. Companions can't attune to magic items unless they have a specific ability that allows them to do so.</p><p><em><strong>Companion Barding.</strong></em> You can purchase armour for your companion. Any type of armour can be purchased as barding. The cost and weight is doubled for each size category above Medium, and halved for each size category below Small.

Working out what ability a creature’s attack or saving throw uses can require a bit of detective work.</p><p>First you have to know the creature’s proficiency bonus (PB). Luckily this is quite easy: it all depends on the creature’s CR and players’ PB. A creatures’ base PB is +2 at CR 0-4 and +3 at CR 5-6. To proceed, subtract the creature’s PB from its modifiers/save DCs. For save DCs, subtract an additional 8 from the DC. Finally, match the remaining values to the ability score modifiers.</p><p>Let’s use the CR 4 red dragon wyrmling’s bite attack and breath weapon as an example. It has a PB of +2, a Strength of 19 (+4), a Dexterity of 10 (+0), and a Constitution of 17 (+3). Its bite attack has a +6 mod\u0002ifier, while its breath weapon has a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. Subtracting the PB from these values (and 8 from the DC), we are left with +4 and DC 3. We can deduce that the bite attack uses Strength (the +4 matches the wyrmling’s Strength modifier), and the fire breath uses Constitution (DC 3 matches the wyrmling’s +3 Constitution modifier).</p><p>If the wyrmling’s tamer is 13th level (with a PB of +5), then the wyrmling’s PB increases from +2 to +5 when it becomes a companion. This results in its attack modifi\u0002er and save DC increasing to +9 and DC 16, respectively</p></blockquote>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":null,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":"","units":""},"cover":null,"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":"","actionType":"save","attackBonus":"","chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"cha","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"type":{"value":"class","subtype":""},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"aeon1awsZp1ZKjRu":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.vtNasvaHTHtGYJLB"},"cf":{"id":"temp_n6e9e9cg6ir"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.1.5","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1677870619648,"modifiedTime":1679683781611,"lastModifiedBy":"aeon1awsZp1ZKjRu"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"iNVonTnCUi0x3rPQ"}
